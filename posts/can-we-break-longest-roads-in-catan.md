One way to break the longest road is by building another longest road in Catan, But if that is not possible you can also break it by building a House/ City in middle of the opponent's road. Following images shows you how to do that.

Its not always possible to break your opponent's road, for example consider the following case,  Where you can't build a house so that you can split the road into smaller than 5
